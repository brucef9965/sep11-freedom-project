* I used <a href = "https://aframe.io/">Aframe</a> and <a href = "https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>
* I used an aframe code, put it to jsbin, and then replace the shapes with a stick figure.
* I have no challenges for now.
* I don't have any questions yet.
* I will try to tinker with a code on three.js
