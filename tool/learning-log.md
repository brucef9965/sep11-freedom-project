* I used <a href = "https://aframe.io/">Aframe</a> and <a href = "https://threejs.org/">Three.js</a>
* I used an aframe code, put it to jsbin, and then replace the shapes with a stick figure.
* I have no challenges for now.
* I don't have any questions yet.
* I will try to tinker with a code on three.js

* This the basic code in order for your aframe project to work.
```html
<html>
    <head>
        <script src="https://aframe.io/releases/1.5.0/aframe.min.js"></script>
    </head>
</html>
```
* So I learned how to use the basic for all of the primitives of <b>Aframe.</b> Since I studied them I decided to create a new html for primitives so that I can tinker and practice my creation until the freedom project
```html
<a-scene background="color: black">
    <!-- This is a shape of Pac Man in 2D -->
    <a-cylinder color="yellow" theta-start="50" theta-length="280" side="double" position="0 0 -5" rotation="0 90 90"></a-cylinder>
</a-scene>
```
