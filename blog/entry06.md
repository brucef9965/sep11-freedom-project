Context: My next step to create a 3d website that plays music for a frame was to learn how to animate the components I am using. I already learned how to animate the components by knowing how to make them revolve, rotate, and move in different places. Now I took the initiative to learn how to add sounds in the aframe website such as music. Not only that I used javascript to baisically add the if statement that plays music when you click on the spheres.

Content: Some of my takwaways from giving my in-class presentation is to maintain confidence and edit the slides that will keep the viewers attetion to your slide. I also explain the codes I used and made sure I kept the presentation brief. Even when I made a few mistakes like stuttering a bit, or showing some small amount of nervousness, I also gave more eye contact towards my audience and explained my takeaways I learned while making the website.
